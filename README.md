## Getting Started

### Environment Setup
```
conda create --name memoryllm
conda activate memoryllm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Load Model
First clone the repository and get into the repository: 
```
git clone git@github.com:wangyu-ustc/MemoryLLM.git
cd MemoryLLM
```
Then simply use the following code to load the model:
```python
import torch
from modeling_memoryllm import MemoryLLM
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# load pretrained model
model = MemoryLLM.from_pretrained("YuWangX/memoryllm-8b", attn_implementation="flash_attention_2", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("YuWangX/memoryllm-8b")
model = model.cuda()

# load chat model
model = MemoryLLM.from_pretrained("YuWangX/memoryllm-8b-chat", attn_implementation="flash_attention_2", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("YuWangX/memoryllm-8b-chat")
model = model.cuda()
```
If you want to use MemoryLLM-7B (the last version), please go to the branch `memoryllm-7b`. 

### How to use the model
Inject a piece of context into the model using the following script:
```python

# Self-Update with the new context
ctx = "Last week, John had a wonderful picnic with David. During their conversation, David mentioned multiple times that he likes eating apples. Though he didn't mention any other fruits, John says he can infer that David also like bananas."

# please make sure the context to inject into the memory is larger than 16 tokens, this is the hard minimum when training the model. The memory will be disturbed when less than 16 tokens are injected into the memory. 
model.inject_memory(tokenizer(ctx, return_tensors='pt', add_special_tokens=False).input_ids.cuda(), update_memory=True)
```

Then for chat model, use the following template: 
```python
# Generation
messages = [{
    'role': 'user', "content": "What fruits does David like?",
}]

inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_tensors="pt", add_generation_prompt=True)[:, 1:] # remove bos tokens as the model has its own trained bos embeddings.
terminators = [
    tokenizer.eos_token_id,
    tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids("<|eot_id|>")
]

outputs = model.generate(input_ids=inputs.cuda(),
                         max_new_tokens=20,
                         eos_token_id=terminators)

response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])
```

For the pretrained model, use the following template:
```python
inputs = tokenizer("Question: What fruits does David like? Answer: David likes", return_tensors='pt', add_special_tokens=False).input_ids.cuda()
outputs = model.generate(input_ids=inputs, max_new_tokens=20)
response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0][inputs.shape[1]:])
```

### Evaluation

#### Model Editing Evaluations
We put our reimplementation of various model-editing baselines and `MemoryLLM` in the repo [EditingLlama](https://github.com/wangyu-ustc/EditingLlama). 

#### Customized Experiments
To prepare the dataset, please download from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/YuWangX/KnowledgeRetention). Please download the dataset and put them as the following structure: 
```
- data
  - squad
    - indices_squad_3.npy
    - dev-v2.0.json
    - train-v2.0.json
  - nq 
    - indices_nq_4.npy
    - v1.0-simplified_nq-dev-all.jsonl
    - v1.0-simplified_simplified-nq-train.jsonl
```
We will evaluate our model on the validation set where the unrelated contexts are sampled from the training set. To evaluate the model, we could use the following script: 

```
mkdir results
python test_qa_memory.py --model YuWangX/memoryllm-7b --nuc 10 --datasets naturalqa squad --num_samples 100
```
here `nuc` means the number of irrelevant contexts, and `naturalqa squad` means the datasets to evaluate the model on.

#### Evaluation on Longbench

```
python longbench_pred.py --model memoryllm-7b --datasets hotpotqa --max_length 16384
```
Here `max_length` is the maximum length used when truncating the context.
Then the generated results are all saved in the folder `longbench` for evaluation.

#### Evaluation results on MemoryLLM-8B
Evaluation results on the knowledge-retention tasks are as follows: (we updated the evaluation dataset by filtering out the examples whose questions can be answered by Llama3-8B. The new dataset is [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/YuWangX/KnowledgeRetentionProcessed))

### Training
In our implementations, we train Llama2-7B on C4 dataset. However, this may lead to the poor performance on the benchmark `qasper` (see Figure 4 in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04624)). Thus we put the script of training on red-pajama here, which is the dataset we have been using in the models we are currently exploring. 

Please check the folder `train` using the following command:
```
cd train
```
#### Dataset Preparation
Please follow the instructions below to prepare the datasets: (make sure you have the datasets from [here](https://github.com/wangyu-ustc/MemoryLLM?tab=readme-ov-file#customized-experiments) prepared.)
```
cd data

# Please use the softlink to link the validation datasets into the current directory.
ln -s ../../data/nq ./
ln -s ../../data/squad ./

# Then please download the redpajama dataset
cd redpajama
sh download.sh
```

After preparing all the datasets, you can run the following code to start training:
```
python main.py -t --base MemoryLLM/configs/llama/llama_30x256.yaml
```
We have not conducted training on openllama but we do have the script on openllama for debugging purposes. So if you want to see the training on openllama, please run the following command:
```
python main.py -t --base MemoryLLM/configs/openllama/openllama_4x256.yaml
```
